# An analysis of kickstarter campaign
In this project we analyzed data in Excel in order to help Louise, her objective is to start a crowdfunding campaign so she can fund her play with an estimate budget over 10,000 dlls, and after taking a look over the data, we could make few conclusions, so she can have a better picture of the scene; this way, she is going to be able to choose the best option to reach her goal. 

### Central Tendency Data and Measures of Spread
First of all, we realized that the mean goal of failed US kickstarters was double the mean goal of succesful ones, $10,0000, this means that they were expecting so much more than they should without being realistics, that is why the goal has to be related with real data so that could lead to a fortunate ending. The same happened with the standard deviation of goal, for failed kickstarters was of $21,968, while for the successful ones, was of $7,749. Since the mean and median pledged of succesful are so much higher than failed ones, we can notice there are more factors that prevent the second ones to succeed.

### Theater Outcomes
As we can see in this chart, there has been a percentage of 58% succesful events, meanwhile the failed has 38% of the total, the rest belongs to live with a 1% and canceled with a 3%. In conclussion it has been more likely to succed in this category based in the past few months data.

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Clearly the top months to perform were summer months, May to August, being May the best month, maybe due to the fact that people enjoy more to go out during the beggining of the warm season. February, March, April and October were good as well; while January, September, November and December didn't perform as good as the others.
