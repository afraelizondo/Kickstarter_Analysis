# An analysis of kickstarter campaign
### Overview of project
The performance of this analysis was made with the main objective of helping Louise with her crowdfunding campaign in order to raise over $10,000 for her upcoming play called “Fever”. She is so excited about it and wants to choose the best decisions to make a successful campaign. Using Excel and the Kickstarter dataset, we were able to analyze data about similar events that happened in the past years and their results, as well as some factors that affected them. This way Louise is going to be able to evaluate possible solutions and paths to accomplish her goal. 

### Analysis and challenges
The analysis was performed based on a large range of data, that’s why we had to filter certain outcomes, in this way we were able to get more specific results. Creating Pivot Tables was the best way to transform the relevant information into charts that can be easily presented. 
First, we filtered the Theater Parent Category and made a Pivot Table, as shown. The rows indicate the month of performance and the columns the outcomes, divided in 839 successful, 493 failed and 37 canceled between the years 2009 and 2017. 
As second, we just analyzed the information of the Plays, in this case we got a total of 1066, divided in 694 successful, 353 failed and 19 live. As we can see there is a higher percentage of successful in this subcategory.

Since this is my first-time analyzing charts, for me, the most difficult challenge was to know what information is relevant and how could it help to our study purpose. Even it wasn’t my first-time using Excel, I used formulas I didn’t knew, so getting used to them and their structure was another challenge, not so complicated though. 


## Results

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
My conclusions based on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart were mainly, that there are more possibilities of successful when performing in summer months, since the people really enjoy doing activities with the warm weather, that’s why May to July were the best months overall, being May, which is the first month of the season, the top one with 111 successful dates out of 166, even though they had really good percentage of successful events, the chart is showing that there were many failed ones too, so this indicates there are some external factors besides the season that increases this percentage.
While December, had the highest percentage of failed ones, with 46%. This could mean that people prefer to spend the end of the year in their homes, so is not a good time to perform a play.

### Outcomes based on goals
The highest percentage of successful was in those events that had a goal of less than 1,000 to 4,999, and that could be obvious because is the lowest range of all, based on this statement we can jump to the conclusion that the higher the goal, the higher chances to fail. 
On the other hand, the ones with a goal between 35,000 and 44,999 had a great successful rate with a 67% out of 100%, this could mean they chose a great public target or good season to perform. 
The range between 25,000 to 34,999 and 45,000 to 49,999 had the highest percentage of failed events.
We can see in the chart that the percentage failed is increasing as the goal gets higher, but then in the range of 35,000 to 44,999 it comes down again, while the break point of the percentage successful is exactly in the same range. 
There was a 0% percentage canceled, so this one doesn’t appear

### Limitations of Dataset
One of the main limitations is that we can’t really know the exact place where the events occurred, only the whole country, and there can be external factors due to the geographical position that may affect the performance. Also, we don’t know which was the public target of the plays and that is an important factor because is where the money came from and is basically the main goal of this fundraising. 

We could have created a table only with the events occurred in last year, this because is fresh data and maybe more accurate. 
Another kind of graph that could be helpful is one with the average donation, so maybe we can notice which kind of plays do the people enjoy more to contribute to.
